This Java code represents a program for managing a parking garage in New York City. The program enables users to perform actions like parking cars, retrieving cars, and viewing a list of parked cars. The parking duration and charges are determined based on a fixed rate.

1. **Nycgarage Class:**
   - Represents the main class for the parking garage management program.
   - Contains the `main` method where the program execution begins.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initializes a list to store Car objects, creates a Scanner for user input, and initializes the primary variable.

3. **Pre-existing Cars:**
   - Adds some pre-existing Car objects to the list for testing purposes.

4. **User Interaction Loop:**
   - Utilizes a do-while loop for continuous user interaction until the user inputs 137923.

5. **Parking (User Choice 1):**
   - If the user chooses to park, prompts for plate number and expected duration.
   - Creates a new Car object and adds it to the list.
   - Calls the `sortCarsByDuration` method to sort the list by expected duration.

6. **Retrieving a Car (User Choice 2):**
   - If the user chooses to retrieve a car, prompts for the plate number.
   - Calculates the total charge based on the parking duration.
   - Removes the retrieved car from the list.

7. **Listing All Cars (User Choice 3):**
   - If the user chooses to view the list of cars, prints information for each car.

8. **Custom Comparator for Sorting:**
   - Defines a custom comparator to sort cars by expected duration using `Comparator.naturalOrder()`.
